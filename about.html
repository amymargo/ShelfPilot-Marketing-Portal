                At ShelfPilot, our story began with a vision to transform the wholesale distribution landscape by fostering direct connections between brands and small businesses. Our mission is to simplify and enhance the way retailers access high-quality products, ensuring that every small business has the opportunity to thrive. We believe that by empowering these local retailers, we create a stronger, more vibrant marketplace.
